This repo contains my webpage and a couple convenience modules for go to make development of
small web services faster for my setup.

- `kra/cmd/krapage` - my webpage
- `kra/web` - http helper that returns a HTTP server listening on Tailscale and Localhost
- `kra/html` - html elements for making webpages using [elem-go](https://github.com/chasefleming/elem-go)
